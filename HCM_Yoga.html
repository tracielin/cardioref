<p></p><div class=\"notrecommend\"><b><u>FYI:</b></u><p>The following are NOT recommended:<br>-<b>Beta Blocker for sport:</b> Pharmacologic agents to control cardiac-related symptoms or ventricular tachyarrhythmias should NOT be administered for the <u>sole</u> purpose of permitting participation in high-intensity sports. Notably, such drugs may also be inconsistent with maximal physical performance in most sports<br>-<b>Prophylactic ICD:</b> Should not be placed in athletes with HCM for the <u>sole</u> or primary purpose of permitting participation in high-intensity sports competition because of the possibility of device-related complications. ICD indications for competitive athletes with HCM should not differ from those in nonathlete patients with HCM.</div></p>
