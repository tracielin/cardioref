<p>"Athletes with a probable or unequivocal clinical expression and diagnosis of HCM (ie, with the disease phenotype of <u>LV hypertrophy</u>) should <em><u>not</u></em> participate in most competitive sports, with the exception of those of low intensity (class IA sports)"
</p><p>"This recommendation is independent of age, sex, magnitude of LV hypertrophy, particular sarcomere mutation, presence or absence of LV outflow obstruction (at rest or with physiological exercise), absence of prior cardiac symptoms, presence or absence of late gadolinium enhancement (fibrosis) on CMR, and whether major interventions such as surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation have been performed previously (Class III; Level of Evidence C)."

<p class="sectiontitle">Without LV Hypertrophy</p>
<p>
"Participation in competitive athletics for <u>asymptomatic</u>, genotype-positive HCM patients
<u>without evidence of LV hypertrophy</u> by 2-dimensional echocardiography and CMR is <em>reasonable</em>,
particularly in the <u>absence of a family history of HCM-related sudden death</u> (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C)."

  <p class="sectiontitle_notrec">Not Recommended</p>
  <p>The following are NOT recommended:</p>
  <span class="sectiontitle">Beta Blocker for sport:</span>
  Pharmacologic agents to control cardiac-related symptoms or ventricular tachyarrhythmias should NOT be administered for the <u>sole</u> purpose of permitting participation in high-intensity sports. Notably, such drugs may also be inconsistent with maximal physical performance in most sports
  <br><br>
  <span class="sectiontitle">Prophylactic ICD:</span>
  Should not be placed in athletes with HCM for the <u>sole</u> or primary purpose of permitting participation in high-intensity sports competition because of the possibility of device-related complications. ICD indications for competitive athletes with HCM should not differ from those in nonathlete patients with HCM.
