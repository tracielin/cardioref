Note: The decision tree below is a graphic interpretation of the ACC/AHA 2015 guideline, as perceived by the creator of CardioRef, who was not a part of the expert panel involved in the guideline creation. The creator of CardioRef would strongly recommend that you read the <a href ="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000242">full guideline</a> for further clarification. Feedback regarding the interpretive figure below is welcome.

<b>Before applying the following decision tree, please note the following:* </b><br>
<ul>
  <li>"The diagnosis of hypertension is based on the subject having an elevated BP at or above certain levels
    measured by routine sphygmomanometry under appropriate conditions on at least 2 separate occasions separated by at least 1 week" (Chobanian 2003)</li>
  <li>"People >18 years of age with a BP >140 mm Hg systolic and/or >90 mm Hg diastolic are considered to have hypertension" (Chobanian 2003)</li>
  <li>"In children and adolescents, hypertension is defined as average systolic or diastolic BP levels greater than the 95th percentile for sex, age, and height; however, earlier physical maturation of the competitive athlete leaves open to question
    when an adult age criterion for hypertension should be applied to the adolescent." (Moyer 2013)</li>
  <li>"In determining the level of competitive athletic activity that a hypertensive person may engage in, it is also important to determine the degree of hypertension-related target-organ damage."</li>
  <li>"For the general population, increased levels of noncompetitive recreational physical activity are generally regarded as beneficial...
Those who are hypertensive derive protection from both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by maintaining higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness." (Church 2001)</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000242#T1">Guidelines for Clinic/Office BP Measurement</a></li>
   <li>"In an adolescent or young adult (ie, < 25 years of age) with stage 2 hypertension, it may be appropriate to refer this person for further evaluation
     and therapy to a cardiologist or hypertension specialist. The workup for secondary forms of hypertension and proper pharmacological management is often
     outside the scope of general pediatricians and family practitioners who might otherwise be seeing these athletes" </li>
